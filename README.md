# javayporter.com

## Project Description

javayporter.com was designed to share my professional background and related personal experiences with the world. The application provides an engaging user friendly UI and allows users to do the following:

- Navigate to various pages for specific content
- Download a copy of my most recent resume
- Send me an email and/or join my mailing list
- Read and comment on my developer blogs (Coming Soon!)

### Technologies Used

This react project was created using **Vite**, a local development server.

- JavaScript
- React
- React Bootstrap
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- App Engine

### Challenges

Deploying the project on GCP was initially challenging. This project is the first I attempted to deploy on the platfrom. I ran into issues with build files and triggering build events. Diving deeper into GCP documentation and reviewing posts from other developers with similar issues helped me overcome the challenges.
